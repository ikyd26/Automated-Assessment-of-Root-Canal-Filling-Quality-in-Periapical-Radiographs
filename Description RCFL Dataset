RCFL Dataset: Periapical Radiographs of Root Canal Fillings

The RCFL dataset is a collection of 735 periapical radiographs (PRs) of root canal fillings (RCFs) performed by third-year dental students at Burdur Mehmet Akif Ersoy University Faculty of Dentistry between 2023 and 2025. These radiographs were acquired during preclinical endodontic training on extracted human teeth, providing a realistic simulation of clinical root canal treatment before students advance to treating patients. Each image in the dataset captures the full length of the tooth roots and adjacent periapical area, allowing for evaluation of the technical quality of the root canal filling. Imaging Procedure: All samples were imaged using a Hy-Scan phosphor plate scanner (MyRay, Imola, Italy) coupled with a standard intraoral X-ray unit (NewTom, Imola, Italy). Radiographs were taken under consistent exposure parameters (70 kVp, 4 mA, 0.220 s) to ensure uniform image quality across the dataset. The resulting digital radiographs were archived at a resolution of 418 × 836 pixels, which preserves sufficient detail for assessment of RCF length, density, and taper in each tooth. Inclusion Criteria: The dataset focuses on root canal treatments carried out with stainless steel hand files on fully developed tooth roots. All included teeth had mature apices and were instrumented manually using hand files as part of the students’ training exercises. This ensured that the cases represented standard endodontic scenarios without developmental anomalies. Exclusion Criteria: Teeth presenting complex root anatomies or conditions were omitted to maintain consistency and avoid confounding factors. Specifically, cases with fused roots, additional (accessory) canals, C-shaped canal systems, any form of internal or external resorption, or severely curved roots were excluded from the dataset. Radiographs that did not clearly show the entire root length or at least 2 mm of periapical area (necessary to detect overfills or periapical status) were also excluded. By applying these criteria, the RCFL dataset emphasizes typical root canal treatments and omits anatomically aberrant cases that were beyond the scope of the students’ preclinical training. Ethical Compliance: All collected radiographs and procedures within this dataset adhere to institutional ethical guidelines. The use of extracted human teeth for educational and research purposes was approved by the Ethics Committee of Burdur Mehmet Akif Ersoy University (Approval No: 01-2025/851). No patient-identifying information is associated with the images, and the dataset was compiled in accordance with relevant regulations and informed consent standards for the use of human biological materials in research.

Data Availability: Due to ethical constraints and institutional policies, the RCFL dataset is not publicly available. However, the data can be made accessible upon reasonable request to the author listed below. All requests will be reviewed to ensure compliance with relevant institutional and ethical guidelines. If approved, qualified researchers may receive access to the radiographic data for non-commercial, academic purposes in accordance with the conditions of the ethical approval.
